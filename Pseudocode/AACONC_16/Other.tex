	Because this is a new problem there are no existing instances with which we can test the algorithm, so we will create new random ones with the following structure:
	$number of customers$ $number of depots$ $number of different vehicle types$\\
	$capacity_{vt_1}, capacity_{vt_2}, ..., capacity_{vt_n}$
