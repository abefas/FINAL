	\section{Variables}
		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $V = \{D\cup C\}$ : total vertices, Depots \& Customers\
		\item $VT$ : total Vehicle Types\
		\item $D$ : total Depots\
		\item $R$ : solution\
		\item $K$ : cluster matrix\
		\item $\tau$ : pheromone matrix
		\item $n_{ants}$ : number of ants in colonies\
		\item $n_{freq}$ : frequency of the local optimization\
		\item $n_{prim}$ : number of primary clusters\
		\item $n_{size}$ : number of vertices in clusters\
		\item $n_{sect}$ : number of sectors\
		\item $T_{update}$ : temperature udpating coefficient\
		\item $\alpha_{update}$ : temperature cooling coefficient\
		\item  $\rho_{min}, \rho_{max}$ : minimum and maximum limits of the pheromone evaporation coefficient\ 
		\item  $\delta$ : pheromone updating coefficient\
		\item $\lambda$ : drones' pheromone updating coefficient\
		\item $\alpha$ : distance probability coefficient\
		\item $\beta$ : pheromone probability coefficient\
	\end{itemize}
	At the initial phase of the algorithm, the pheromone matrix $\tau$ is initialized using (1). $\tau$ is a 4-dimensional matrix.\\\\
	$\tau_{ij}^{(k)(h)} = 1$ for all $v_i, v_j\in V, \text{ }vt_k\in VT$ and $d_h\in D$ (6)\\\\
	Pheromone matrix update, evaporation coefficient $\rho$ and pheromone evaporation follow the same principles with the original AACO-NC found \href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9991848}{here}.\\\\
	\newline
	Because of the addition of drones, which function in a star graph, moving only from depots to customers and back, adjustment was needed to the drone pheromone values to prevent them becoming so strong that they're the only type selected in each ant iteration. More specifically, we present a new update coefficient for drones in the pheromone update procedure:\\
	\input{phUpdate.tex}\
	\newline
	And in the evaporation procedure:\\
	\input{evaporation.tex}\
	The node clustering technique also follows the original paper, which can be found 
	\href{https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJBIC.2016.078639}{here}.\\
	Although in this algorithm, each vertex has more than one set of clusters, which is equal to the number of different vehicle types. This is because of the inability of certain vehicles to visit every vertex.
	Also, the drone clusters do not make use of the sectoring technique because that sometimes results in drones being assigned to too far away customers which is suboptimal and not realistic for large area instances.
	
	
	\section{Functions}
	
	In general, the functions used in this algorithm are slightly altered versions of the ones presented in the AACO-NC for the MDVRP by Stodola, with the purpose of adapting the AACO-NC algorithm to solve the MD-mfcmTSP.\\\\
	The MD-mfcmTSP differs from the MDVRP in the following ways:\\
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Supports multiple vehicle types (different capacities and speeds).\
		\item Each vehicle type has an assigned speed.\
		\item Considers realistic scenarios where big vehicles cannot access certain customers and drone safe landing spaces (not all customers can be serviced by drone).\
		\item Minimizes makespan instead of distance.\
		\item Vehicle capacity is dictated by the vehicle type and not by the vehicle's depot (depots are considered always stocked and as a reloading station for their vehicles).\
		\item Not every depot has to have the same number of vehicles or vehicle types assigned (e.g. Depot 1 has 4 trucks, Depot 2 has 10 drones and Depot 3 has 3 trucks, 5 motorcycles and 7 drones).\
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\section{Other}

	Because this is a new problem, there are no existing instances with which we can test the algorithm so we use Cordeau MDVRP instances while changing the demand of all customers to 1 and randomly setting each customer's accessibility with the probabilities:\\
	85\% to be accessible by drones\\
	80\% to be accessible by truck\\
	while all customers can be accessed by motorbikes.\\
